### Next Steps

1. **Verify on GitHub**: Visit your repository online to confirm
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in each directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   cd ../simple-server && npm install
   ```
3. **Continue Development**: Your TypeScript migration is complete and ready for production!

### Error Resolution

- Aggressive garbage collection with `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`
- Force pushing the cleaned history to GitHub
